/* 
 * Here we override some CSS to make a Luminous object more print-friendly.
 * as well as some layout, we override a few colours of the light theme. 
 * This is because some colours do not print well (grey comments => green)
 * and boldness appears to be dropped from keywords, thereby removing all their
 * highlighting (these are changed to a purple colour)
